What is the most likely continuation of the following sequence?
Give the response as a number (with a base prefix if appropriate), with no additional commentary.

The sequence is in base 2.
Q: 0b101,0b111,0b1000,0b1010
A: ","
Here are some examples of sequence explanations, i.e. python functions
which generated the preceding sequences base 2. Assume the first number was generated by f(0),
the second by f(1), the third by f(2), and so on.


Q: 0b100,0b101,0b110,0b111
Explanation: lambda x: bin([i for i in range(100) if i % (3 + 1) or i % (6 + 1)][(x + 3)])

Q: 0b1010,0b1100,0b1110,0b10000

What is the most likely function which generated the following sequence?
Assume the first number was generated by f(0), the second by f(1), the third by f(2), and so on.
The function should output the number in the same representation as the sequence.
Give the response in the format:
Explanation: <function>

The sequence is in base 2.
